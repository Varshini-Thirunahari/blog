    <h1>MY PROJECTS</h1>

    <div class="project">
        <h2>(i) Hand Gesture Recognition</h2>
        <img src="hand.jpg" alt="Hand Gesture Recognition Image" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;">
        <h3>Domain of the project: Image Processing</h3>
        <p>Hand gesture recognition is a natural way of human-computer interaction. This is an area with many different possible applications, giving users a simpler and more natural way to communicate with robots/systems interfaces, without the need for extra devices and physical contact. So, the primary goal of gesture recognition research applied to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is to create systems that can identify specific human gestures and use them to convey information or control videos like volume up or down, mute or unmute, forward or backward. For that, vision-based hand gesture interfaces require fast and extremely robust hand detection and gesture recognition in real-time by using Image Processing technology and Python using OpenCV and some libraries.</p>

        <h2>(ii) RoadSafe AI</h2>
        <img src="road.jpg" alt="RoadSafe AI Image" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;">
        <h3>Domain of the project: Deep Learning</h3>
        <p>In response to the escalating issue of motorcycle riders disregarding helmet regulations in India, our project introduces an innovative Non-Helmet Rider detection system. The existing manual approach, relying on CCTV recordings, faces challenges in handling the increasing traffic violations. Our solution utilizes advanced deep learning with YOLOv2 and YOLOv3 at three levels, automating the detection of persons, motorcycles, absence of helmets, and license plates. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) streamlines the extraction of license plate registration numbers. The project stands out for its emphasis on efficiency and speed, addressing limitations seen in previous research. By integrating various features, it delivers a comprehensive solution for both helmet detection and license plate extraction. This holistic approach contributes to road safety by efficiently automating the identification of helmet violations and extracting crucial license plate information, making our roads safer for everyone.</p>
